# Analysis-of-PM-2.5-and-PM-10-in-Nigeria
In this analysis, I delve into the PM2.5 and PM10 data for the year 2020 in Nigeria, leveraging Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The choice of Nigeria as the focal point holds dual significance. 

Firstly, it offers a pertinent case study for assessing the attention that developing nations, like Nigeria, are directing towards air quality control and assessment.

Secondly, it was reported that many cities recorded temporary improvements in air quality due to lockdowns in 2020 which is the year my analysis focuses on and also check PM concentration reduction in Nigeria


The year 2020 brought an unexpected dip in air pollution. In 2021, we will likely see an increase in air pollution due to human activity, again," said Frank Hammes, CEO of IQAir. "We hope this report will highlight that urgent action is both possible and necessary to combat air pollution, which remains the world's greatest environmental health threat."
